1. after the user has successfully logged in with google oAuth, we don't use the google ID anymore,
   we only concern with the ID stored in mongo DB
  
2. everytime we access mongo db, it is always an asynchronous call, so we need to handle it (.then())
3. cookieSession is used to give our app access to cookies
4. to run 2 server at a time (client and server), create 2 scripts, then install concurrently
    "server": "nodemon index.js",
    "client": "npm run start --prefix client",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""

5. PRODUCTION CONFIG WITH EXPRES-REACT
"heroku-postbuild":
      "NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
